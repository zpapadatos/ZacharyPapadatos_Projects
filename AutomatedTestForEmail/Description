The EmailEvaluationTestingAutomation class automates the testing of email validation by running a series of
predefined test cases using the EmailRecognizer class. It checks various email formats against expected
validation rules, such as proper character usage, length constraints, and the presence of required symbols. The
program tracks the number of passed and failed tests, printing detailed results for each case. It uses a finite
state machine approach to determine whether an email is valid or invalid and reports discrepancies between
expected and actual outcomes.
