In this program For My CSE 325 class, I was tasked by the mission statement to create a program that could translate a inputted English sentence into morse code. 
It also had the functionality of a word counter and was able to switch between the red or green light on my FRDM board depending on if the word was the odd word 
of the string or the even word.
